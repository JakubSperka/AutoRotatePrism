## ARP Control Panel

The **ARP Control Panel** is a Python application designed for interacting with the ARP (Automatic Rotating Prism) device used in geodetic surveying. This graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies communication with the device and facilitates basic parameter calculations for prism rotation, integrating with the Blynk server via API.

### Key Features

The control panel encompasses several functional areas aimed at ease of use and intuitive operation:

1. **Point Lists and Editing Tools**
   - Manage and insert survey points efficiently.

2. **Geodetic Equipment Parameters**
   - Handle and modify parameters related to surveying equipment.

3. **Status Panel for Selected Equipment**
   - Monitor the status of selected equipment and environmental attributes.

4. **ARP Rotation Controls**
   - Execute prism rotation commands.

5. **Map Window with Raster Layers**
   - Visualize survey data on map backgrounds.

6. **Map Display Functions**
   - Explore map functionalities for data visualization.

7. **Point Creation from Map Selection**
   - Generate survey points directly from the map interface.

### User Interface Layout

The UI is logically organized into frames to group related functionalities:

1. **Map Window Frame**
   - Display and control the map view.

2. **Points of Network Frame**
   - Manage survey points and temporary locations.

3. **Status and Control Frame**
   - Monitor equipment status and execute control commands.

### Development Tools

The application is developed in Python, utilizing the Tkinter library for creating the graphical interface. Additional libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Requests, and Pyproj are employed to implement required functionalities.
